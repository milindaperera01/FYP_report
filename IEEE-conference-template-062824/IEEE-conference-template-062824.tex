\begin{abstract}
Distinguishing between simple physiological arousal and the maladaptive state of true stress is crucial. 
This harmful condition arises when environmental demands exceed an organism's coping capacity, impairing physiological 
recovery. Due to its widespread negative impact, early and accurate detection of maladaptive stress is vital 
for protecting personal, social, and economic wellbeing in today’s fast-paced world. Electroencephalography (EEG), 
as a primary method for monitoring neural activity, has shown significant promise in identifying the distinct 
brain states associated with this stress. Modern deep learning architectures provide a powerful approach by 
automatically extracting meaningful patterns and hierarchical features from complex EEG data. This comprehensive 
survey offers researchers, practitioners, and technology enthusiasts a definitive overview of current advancements 
and highlights the future directions of EEG-based stress detection using deep learning.

\section{Introduction}
Stress is any intrinsic or extrinsic stimulus that evokes a biological response, and it can be a triggering or aggravating factor for many pathological
 conditions [THE IMPACT OF STRESS ON BODY FUNCTION: A REVIEW]. This response is broadly categorized as acute stress, which results from the demands and
  pressures of the recent past or near future, or chronic stress, which is caused by long-standing pressures [A Survey of Affective Computing for 
  Stress Detection]. If a stressor is overwhelming and cannot be resolved, it becomes chronic, leaving neuroendocrine parameters altered and 
  compromising the immune system [The effects of chronic stress on health: new insights into the molecular mechanisms of brain–body communication].
   This chronic state is linked to a wide range of serious illnesses, including cardiovascular dysfunctions, diabetes, cancer, and mental illnesses
    like depression [The effects of chronic stress on health: new insights into the molecular mechanisms of brain–body communication]. Furthermore, 
    chronic stress can lead to macroscopic structural changes in the brain, such as atrophy, which in turn can cause significant disorders related to 
    cognition and memory [THE IMPACT OF STRESS ON BODY FUNCTION: A REVIEW].To objectively identify stress, research has moved beyond subjective
     questionnaires to focus on measurable physiological signals ****. The most common methods capture the body's autonomic response, primarily by 
     analyzing Heart Rate Variability (HRV) from Electrocardiography (ECG) signals ****. Other validated approaches include measuring Galvanic Skin 
     Response (GSR), which tracks changes in sweat gland activity ****, and using infrared thermography to detect the rapid drop in skin temperature 
     caused by peripheral vasoconstriction ****. While these peripheral signals are effective, another line of inquiry targets the source of the stress
      response itself: the electrical activity of the brain.This makes Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals a prime candidate, as they offer a 
      non-invasive method to directly observe the brain's electrical activity and explore the intricacies of neural activity in response to stimuli.
       EEG is particularly valuable as it allows for the estimation of a person's stress in real-time due to its high temporal resolution. In fact, 
       numerous studies utilizing traditional machine learning (ML) frameworks have already demonstrated significant success in this area. Classic 
       algorithms, particularly the Support Vector Machine (SVM), have proven to be highly effective, with multiple studies achieving impressive 
       classification accuracies well over 90\% in detecting stress from EEG signals.While traditional ML has shown promise, it is often limited by a 
       dependency on manual, time-consuming feature extraction [Deep Learning Approaches for Stress Detection: A Survey; A review on evaluating mental 
       stress by deep learning using EEG signals]. This process requires expert knowledge and may not generalize well across different domains [Deep 
       Learning Approaches for Stress Detection: A Survey]. Deep Learning (DL) architectures have emerged as a powerful alternative, as their key 
       advantage is the ability to automatically learn representative and hierarchical features directly from high-dimensional, heterogeneous data 
       [Deep Learning Approaches for Stress Detection: A Survey; Deep learning for electroencephalogram (EEG) classification tasks: a review]. This 
       end-to-end learning capability is particularly well-suited for the complex, non-stationary, and low signal-to-noise ratio nature of EEG 
       signals, eliminating the need for hand-crafted feature selection [A novel technique for stress detection from EEG signal using hybrid deep 
       learning model; EEG classification of driver mental states by deep learning; A review on evaluating mental stress by deep learning using EEG 
       signals]. Within this domain, specific DL models have shown exceptional promise: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) excel at extracting 
       relevant spatial features [A review on evaluating mental stress by deep learning using EEG signals; Deep learning for electroencephalogram 
       (EEG) classification tasks: a review], while Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks are adept at capturing the crucial temporal dependencies 
       in sequential data [A review on evaluating mental stress by deep learning using EEG signals; A novel technique for stress detection from EEG 
       signal using hybrid deep learning model]. Furthermore, hybrid models combining CNNs and LSTMs are increasingly achieving high classification 
       accuracies by leveraging the strengths of both architectures [A novel technique for stress detection from EEG signal using hybrid deep learning 
       model; A review on evaluating mental stress by deep learning using EEG signals].

\section{Prepare Your Paper Before Styling}
Before you begin to format your paper, first write and save the content as a 
separate text file. Complete all content and organizational editing before 
formatting. Please note sections \ref{AA} to \ref{FAT} below for more information on 
proofreading, spelling and grammar.

Keep your text and graphic files separate until after the text has been 
formatted and styled. Do not number text heads---{\LaTeX} will do that 
for you.

\subsection{Abbreviations and Acronyms}\label{AA}
Define abbreviations and acronyms the first time they are used in the text, 
even after they have been defined in the abstract. Abbreviations such as 
IEEE, SI, MKS, CGS, ac, dc, and rms do not have to be defined. Do not use 
abbreviations in the title or heads unless they are unavoidable.

\subsection{Units}
\begin{itemize}
\item Use either SI (MKS) or CGS as primary units. (SI units are encouraged.) English units may be used as secondary units (in parentheses). An exception would be the use of English units as identifiers in trade, such as ``3.5-inch disk drive''.
\item Avoid combining SI and CGS units, such as current in amperes and magnetic field in oersteds. This often leads to confusion because equations do not balance dimensionally. If you must use mixed units, clearly state the units for each quantity that you use in an equation.
\item Do not mix complete spellings and abbreviations of units: ``Wb/m\textsuperscript{2}'' or ``webers per square meter'', not ``webers/m\textsuperscript{2}''. Spell out units when they appear in text: ``. . . a few henries'', not ``. . . a few H''.
\item Use a zero before decimal points: ``0.25'', not ``.25''. Use ``cm\textsuperscript{3}'', not ``cc''.)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Equations}
Number equations consecutively. To make your 
equations more compact, you may use the solidus (~/~), the exp function, or 
appropriate exponents. Italicize Roman symbols for quantities and variables, 
but not Greek symbols. Use a long dash rather than a hyphen for a minus 
sign. Punctuate equations with commas or periods when they are part of a 
sentence, as in:
\begin{equation}
a+b=\gamma\label{eq}
\end{equation}

Be sure that the 
symbols in your equation have been defined before or immediately following 
the equation. Use ``\eqref{eq}'', not ``Eq.~\eqref{eq}'' or ``equation \eqref{eq}'', except at 
the beginning of a sentence: ``Equation \eqref{eq} is . . .''

\subsection{\LaTeX-Specific Advice}

Please use ``soft'' (e.g., \verb|\eqref{Eq}|) cross references instead
of ``hard'' references (e.g., \verb|(1)|). That will make it possible
to combine sections, add equations, or change the order of figures or
citations without having to go through the file line by line.

Please don't use the \verb|{eqnarray}| equation environment. Use
\verb|{align}| or \verb|{IEEEeqnarray}| instead. The \verb|{eqnarray}|
environment leaves unsightly spaces around relation symbols.

Please note that the \verb|{subequations}| environment in {\LaTeX}
will increment the main equation counter even when there are no
equation numbers displayed. If you forget that, you might write an
article in which the equation numbers skip from (17) to (20), causing
the copy editors to wonder if you've discovered a new method of
counting.

{\BibTeX} does not work by magic. It doesn't get the bibliographic
data from thin air but from .bib files. If you use {\BibTeX} to produce a
bibliography you must send the .bib files. 

{\LaTeX} can't read your mind. If you assign the same label to a
subsubsection and a table, you might find that Table I has been cross
referenced as Table IV-B3. 

{\LaTeX} does not have precognitive abilities. If you put a
\verb|\label| command before the command that updates the counter it's
supposed to be using, the label will pick up the last counter to be
cross referenced instead. In particular, a \verb|\label| command
should not go before the caption of a figure or a table.

Do not use \verb|\nonumber| inside the \verb|{array}| environment. It
will not stop equation numbers inside \verb|{array}| (there won't be
any anyway) and it might stop a wanted equation number in the
surrounding equation.

\subsection{Some Common Mistakes}\label{SCM}
\begin{itemize}
\item The word ``data'' is plural, not singular.
\item The subscript for the permeability of vacuum $\mu_{0}$, and other common scientific constants, is zero with subscript formatting, not a lowercase letter ``o''.
\item In American English, commas, semicolons, periods, question and exclamation marks are located within quotation marks only when a complete thought or name is cited, such as a title or full quotation. When quotation marks are used, instead of a bold or italic typeface, to highlight a word or phrase, punctuation should appear outside of the quotation marks. A parenthetical phrase or statement at the end of a sentence is punctuated outside of the closing parenthesis (like this). (A parenthetical sentence is punctuated within the parentheses.)
\item A graph within a graph is an ``inset'', not an ``insert''. The word alternatively is preferred to the word ``alternately'' (unless you really mean something that alternates).
\item Do not use the word ``essentially'' to mean ``approximately'' or ``effectively''.
\item In your paper title, if the words ``that uses'' can accurately replace the word ``using'', capitalize the ``u''; if not, keep using lower-cased.
\item Be aware of the different meanings of the homophones ``affect'' and ``effect'', ``complement'' and ``compliment'', ``discreet'' and ``discrete'', ``principal'' and ``principle''.
\item Do not confuse ``imply'' and ``infer''.
\item The prefix ``non'' is not a word; it should be joined to the word it modifies, usually without a hyphen.
\item There is no period after the ``et'' in the Latin abbreviation ``et al.''.
\item The abbreviation ``i.e.'' means ``that is'', and the abbreviation ``e.g.'' means ``for example''.
\end{itemize}
An excellent style manual for science writers is \cite{b7}.

\subsection{Authors and Affiliations}\label{AAA}
\textbf{The class file is designed for, but not limited to, six authors.} A 
minimum of one author is required for all conference articles. Author names 
should be listed starting from left to right and then moving down to the 
next line. This is the author sequence that will be used in future citations 
and by indexing services. Names should not be listed in columns nor group by 
affiliation. Please keep your affiliations as succinct as possible (for 
example, do not differentiate among departments of the same organization).

\subsection{Identify the Headings}\label{ITH}
Headings, or heads, are organizational devices that guide the reader through 
your paper. There are two types: component heads and text heads.

Component heads identify the different components of your paper and are not 
topically subordinate to each other. Examples include Acknowledgments and 
References and, for these, the correct style to use is ``Heading 5''. Use 
``figure caption'' for your Figure captions, and ``table head'' for your 
table title. Run-in heads, such as ``Abstract'', will require you to apply a 
style (in this case, italic) in addition to the style provided by the drop 
down menu to differentiate the head from the text.

Text heads organize the topics on a relational, hierarchical basis. For 
example, the paper title is the primary text head because all subsequent 
material relates and elaborates on this one topic. If there are two or more 
sub-topics, the next level head (uppercase Roman numerals) should be used 
and, conversely, if there are not at least two sub-topics, then no subheads 
should be introduced.

\subsection{Figures and Tables}\label{FAT}
\paragraph{Positioning Figures and Tables} Place figures and tables at the top and 
bottom of columns. Avoid placing them in the middle of columns. Large 
figures and tables may span across both columns. Figure captions should be 
below the figures; table heads should appear above the tables. Insert 
figures and tables after they are cited in the text. Use the abbreviation 
``Fig.~\ref{fig}'', even at the beginning of a sentence.

\begin{table}[htbp]
\caption{Table Type Styles}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
\textbf{Table}&\multicolumn{3}{|c|}{\textbf{Table Column Head}} \\

\end{center}
\end{table}

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centerline{\includegraphics{fig1.png}}
\caption{Example of a figure caption.}
\label{fig}
\end{figure}

Figure Labels: Use 8 point Times New Roman for Figure labels. Use words 
rather than symbols or abbreviations when writing Figure axis labels to 
avoid confusing the reader. As an example, write the quantity 
``Magnetization'', or ``Magnetization, M'', not just ``M''. If including 
units in the label, present them within parentheses. Do not label axes only 
with units. In the example, write ``Magnetization (A/m)'' or ``Magnetization 
\{A[m(1)]\}'', not just ``A/m''. Do not label axes with a ratio of 
quantities and units. For example, write ``Temperature (K)'', not 
``Temperature/K''.

\section*{Acknowledgment}

The preferred spelling of the word ``acknowledgment'' in America is without 
an ``e'' after the ``g''. Avoid the stilted expression ``one of us (R. B. 
G.) thanks $\ldots$''. Instead, try ``R. B. G. thanks$\ldots$''. Put sponsor 
acknowledgments in the unnumbered footnote on the first page.

\section*{References}

Please number citations consecutively within brackets \cite{b1}. The 
sentence punctuation follows the bracket \cite{b2}. Refer simply to the reference 
number, as in \cite{b3}---do not use ``Ref. \cite{b3}'' or ``reference \cite{b3}'' except at 
the beginning of a sentence: ``Reference \cite{b3} was the first $\ldots$''

Number footnotes separately in superscripts. Place the actual footnote at 
the bottom of the column in which it was cited. Do not put footnotes in the 
abstract or reference list. Use letters for table footnotes.

Unless there are six authors or more give all authors' names; do not use 
``et al.''. Papers that have not been published, even if they have been 
submitted for publication, should be cited as ``unpublished'' \cite{b4}. Papers 
that have been accepted for publication should be cited as ``in press'' \cite{b5}. 
Capitalize only the first word in a paper title, except for proper nouns and 
element symbols.

For papers published in translation journals, please give the English 
citation first, followed by the original foreign-language citation \cite{b6}.
