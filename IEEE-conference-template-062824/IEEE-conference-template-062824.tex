\begin{abstract}
Distinguishing between simple physiological arousal and the maladaptive state of true stress is crucial. 
This harmful condition arises when environmental demands exceed an organism's coping capacity, impairing physiological 
recovery. Due to its widespread negative impact, early and accurate detection of maladaptive stress is vital 
for protecting personal, social, and economic wellbeing in today’s fast-paced world. Electroencephalography (EEG), 
as a primary method for monitoring neural activity, has shown significant promise in identifying the distinct 
brain states associated with this stress. Modern deep learning architectures provide a powerful approach by 
automatically extracting meaningful patterns and hierarchical features from complex EEG data. This comprehensive 
survey offers researchers, practitioners, and technology enthusiasts a definitive overview of current advancements 
and highlights the future directions of EEG-based stress detection using deep learning.

\section{Introduction}
Stress, a biological response to internal or external stimuli, plays a critical role in exacerbating numerous pathological conditions\cite{yaribeygi2017impact}. 
It is generally classified as acute (short-term) or chronic (long-term), with unresolved chronic stress leading to serious health consequences 
by impairing the immune system and disrupting neuroendocrine functions. This persistent state is associated with a broad spectrum of illnesses, 
including cardiovascular disorders, diabetes, mental health conditions such as depression, and structural brain changes that negatively affect 
cognition and memory\cite{mariotti2015effects}. Recognizing the profound impact of stress, research has shifted toward identifying objective physiological markers 
beyond subjective assessments. Common approaches monitor autonomic nervous system responses through peripheral signals like Heart Rate Variability 
(HRV) from Electrocardiography (ECG), Galvanic Skin Response (GSR), and skin temperature\cite{kyrou2024deep}\cite{vanitha2013hybrid}\cite{herborn2015skin}. However, attention has increasingly turned to the brain’s 
electrical activity as the origin of the stress response, positioning Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals as a valuable, non-invasive, real-time tool 
for assessing neural dynamics. Traditional machine learning (ML) methods, especially Support Vector Machines (SVMs), have shown promise in 
classifying stress states from EEG data. Yet, these methods often depend heavily on manual, time-intensive feature extraction. In contrast, deep 
learning (DL) architectures offer a robust alternative by automatically learning meaningful features from complex, high-dimensional EEG signals. 
Models such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) excel at capturing spatial patterns, while Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks effectively 
model temporal dependencies. Hybrid CNN-LSTM models are increasingly demonstrating superior classification accuracy by integrating both spatial and 
temporal information. This survey aims to deliver a thorough review of EEG-based stress detection using advanced deep learning techniques, analyzing 
current methodologies and performance trends, identifying key challenges, and exploring promising directions for future research.

\section{BACKGROUND}

\subsection{Stress}\label{AA}
Stress is a psychophysiological response of the human body to internal or external stressors, manifesting in physical, mental, or emotional forms. 
It is triggered when an individual perceives a situation as challenging, threatening, or demanding. 
Stressors may be biological, developmental, psychological, socio-cultural, or environmental, and even positive events can disrupt 
homeostasis, the body's internal balance. Stress is generally classified into two main categories: short-term (episodic) and long-term stress (chronic). 
Short-term stress arises from specific tasks or situations such as examinations, deadlines, or sudden pressures. Repeated exposure to such stressors 
may result in episodic stress, often linked to anxiety and hypertension \cite{kyrou2024deep}. Prolonged exposure leads to chronic stress, which can cause depression, 
psychological disorders, and severe physical illnesses. Chronic stress disrupts the nervous system, 
impairs functional capacity, and adversely affects daily life \cite{kyrou2024deep}.

Assessing stress is difficult because people react differently to the same stressor, and the same individual may react differently at different times. Clinical and 
psychological tools such as the Perceived Stress Scale are used for evaluation, but these survey-based methods are better suited for long-term psychological conditions and
 may not capture real-time stress fluctuations \cite{hafeez2024eeg}. In addition, physiological methods use bio-signals like ECG-based HRV, speech patterns, and galvanic skin response, all 
 of which change with mental stress. More recently, EEG has gained attention as a non-invasive and reliable signal for detecting stress-related brain activity, making it a key 
 focus in deep-learning-based stress detection research.

Today, stress has become a major public health concern, intensified by fast-paced lifestyles, heavy workloads, and increasing academic pressure on students. Prolonged or 
unmanaged stress is linked to serious consequences such as depression, cardiovascular disease, weakened immunity, violent behavior, and even suicidal tendencies. These 
risks highlight the growing need for early detection, continuous monitoring, and timely intervention. Establishing reliable and efficient stress-detection frameworks can 
greatly improve overall well-being by helping individuals manage stress more effectively. Such systems can contribute to better academic performance, enhanced workplace 
productivity, and more responsive medical care, making stress detection an essential component of modern health monitoring solutions.
\subsection{Units}
\begin{itemize}
\item Use either SI (MKS) or CGS as primary units. (SI units are encouraged.) English units may be used as secondary units (in parentheses). An exception would be the use of English units as identifiers in trade, such as ``3.5-inch disk drive''.
\item Avoid combining SI and CGS units, such as current in amperes and magnetic field in oersteds. This often leads to confusion because equations do not balance dimensionally. If you must use mixed units, clearly state the units for each quantity that you use in an equation.
\item Do not mix complete spellings and abbreviations of units: ``Wb/m\textsuperscript{2}'' or ``webers per square meter'', not ``webers/m\textsuperscript{2}''. Spell out units when they appear in text: ``. . . a few henries'', not ``. . . a few H''.
\item Use a zero before decimal points: ``0.25'', not ``.25''. Use ``cm\textsuperscript{3}'', not ``cc''.)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Equations}
Number equations consecutively. To make your 
equations more compact, you may use the solidus (~/~), the exp function, or 
appropriate exponents. Italicize Roman symbols for quantities and variables, 
but not Greek symbols. Use a long dash rather than a hyphen for a minus 
sign. Punctuate equations with commas or periods when they are part of a 
sentence, as in:
\begin{equation}
a+b=\gamma\label{eq}
\end{equation}

Be sure that the 
symbols in your equation have been defined before or immediately following 
the equation. Use ``\eqref{eq}'', not ``Eq.~\eqref{eq}'' or ``equation \eqref{eq}'', except at 
the beginning of a sentence: ``Equation \eqref{eq} is . . .''

\subsection{\LaTeX-Specific Advice}

Please use ``soft'' (e.g., \verb|\eqref{Eq}|) cross references instead
of ``hard'' references (e.g., \verb|(1)|). That will make it possible
to combine sections, add equations, or change the order of figures or
citations without having to go through the file line by line.

Please don't use the \verb|{eqnarray}| equation environment. Use
\verb|{align}| or \verb|{IEEEeqnarray}| instead. The \verb|{eqnarray}|
environment leaves unsightly spaces around relation symbols.

Please note that the \verb|{subequations}| environment in {\LaTeX}
will increment the main equation counter even when there are no
equation numbers displayed. If you forget that, you might write an
article in which the equation numbers skip from (17) to (20), causing
the copy editors to wonder if you've discovered a new method of
counting.

{\BibTeX} does not work by magic. It doesn't get the bibliographic
data from thin air but from .bib files. If you use {\BibTeX} to produce a
bibliography you must send the .bib files. 

{\LaTeX} can't read your mind. If you assign the same label to a
subsubsection and a table, you might find that Table I has been cross
referenced as Table IV-B3. 

{\LaTeX} does not have precognitive abilities. If you put a
\verb|\label| command before the command that updates the counter it's
supposed to be using, the label will pick up the last counter to be
cross referenced instead. In particular, a \verb|\label| command
should not go before the caption of a figure or a table.

Do not use \verb|\nonumber| inside the \verb|{array}| environment. It
will not stop equation numbers inside \verb|{array}| (there won't be
any anyway) and it might stop a wanted equation number in the
surrounding equation.

\subsection{Some Common Mistakes}\label{SCM}
\begin{itemize}
\item The word ``data'' is plural, not singular.
\item The subscript for the permeability of vacuum $\mu_{0}$, and other common scientific constants, is zero with subscript formatting, not a lowercase letter ``o''.
\item In American English, commas, semicolons, periods, question and exclamation marks are located within quotation marks only when a complete thought or name is cited, such as a title or full quotation. When quotation marks are used, instead of a bold or italic typeface, to highlight a word or phrase, punctuation should appear outside of the quotation marks. A parenthetical phrase or statement at the end of a sentence is punctuated outside of the closing parenthesis (like this). (A parenthetical sentence is punctuated within the parentheses.)
\item A graph within a graph is an ``inset'', not an ``insert''. The word alternatively is preferred to the word ``alternately'' (unless you really mean something that alternates).
\item Do not use the word ``essentially'' to mean ``approximately'' or ``effectively''.
\item In your paper title, if the words ``that uses'' can accurately replace the word ``using'', capitalize the ``u''; if not, keep using lower-cased.
\item Be aware of the different meanings of the homophones ``affect'' and ``effect'', ``complement'' and ``compliment'', ``discreet'' and ``discrete'', ``principal'' and ``principle''.
\item Do not confuse ``imply'' and ``infer''.
\item The prefix ``non'' is not a word; it should be joined to the word it modifies, usually without a hyphen.
\item There is no period after the ``et'' in the Latin abbreviation ``et al.''.
\item The abbreviation ``i.e.'' means ``that is'', and the abbreviation ``e.g.'' means ``for example''.
\end{itemize}
An excellent style manual for science writers is \cite{b7}.

\subsection{Authors and Affiliations}\label{AAA}
\textbf{The class file is designed for, but not limited to, six authors.} A 
minimum of one author is required for all conference articles. Author names 
should be listed starting from left to right and then moving down to the 
next line. This is the author sequence that will be used in future citations 
and by indexing services. Names should not be listed in columns nor group by 
affiliation. Please keep your affiliations as succinct as possible (for 
example, do not differentiate among departments of the same organization).

\subsection{Identify the Headings}\label{ITH}
Headings, or heads, are organizational devices that guide the reader through 
your paper. There are two types: component heads and text heads.

Component heads identify the different components of your paper and are not 
topically subordinate to each other. Examples include Acknowledgments and 
References and, for these, the correct style to use is ``Heading 5''. Use 
``figure caption'' for your Figure captions, and ``table head'' for your 
table title. Run-in heads, such as ``Abstract'', will require you to apply a 
style (in this case, italic) in addition to the style provided by the drop 
down menu to differentiate the head from the text.

Text heads organize the topics on a relational, hierarchical basis. For 
example, the paper title is the primary text head because all subsequent 
material relates and elaborates on this one topic. If there are two or more 
sub-topics, the next level head (uppercase Roman numerals) should be used 
and, conversely, if there are not at least two sub-topics, then no subheads 
should be introduced.

\subsection{Figures and Tables}\label{FAT}
\paragraph{Positioning Figures and Tables} Place figures and tables at the top and 
bottom of columns. Avoid placing them in the middle of columns. Large 
figures and tables may span across both columns. Figure captions should be 
below the figures; table heads should appear above the tables. Insert 
figures and tables after they are cited in the text. Use the abbreviation 
``Fig.~\ref{fig}'', even at the beginning of a sentence.

\begin{table}[htbp]
\caption{Table Type Styles}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
\textbf{Table}&\multicolumn{3}{|c|}{\textbf{Table Column Head}} \\
\cline{2-4} 
\textbf{Head} & \textbf{\textit{Table column subhead}}& \textbf{\textit{Subhead}}& \textbf{\textit{Subhead}} \\
\hline

\hline
\multicolumn{4}{l}{$^{\mathrm{a}}$Sample of a Table footnote.}

\end{center}
\end{table}

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centerline{\includegraphics{fig1.png}}
\caption{Example of a figure caption.}
\label{fig}
\end{figure}

Figure Labels: Use 8 point Times New Roman for Figure labels. Use words 
rather than symbols or abbreviations when writing Figure axis labels to 
avoid confusing the reader. As an example, write the quantity 
``Magnetization'', or ``Magnetization, M'', not just ``M''. If including 
units in the label, present them within parentheses. Do not label axes only 
with units. In the example, write ``Magnetization (A/m)'' or ``Magnetization 
\{A[m(1)]\}'', not just ``A/m''. Do not label axes with a ratio of 
quantities and units. For example, write ``Temperature (K)'', not 
``Temperature/K''.

\section*{Acknowledgment}

The preferred spelling of the word ``acknowledgment'' in America is without 
an ``e'' after the ``g''. Avoid the stilted expression ``one of us (R. B. 
G.) thanks $\ldots$''. Instead, try ``R. B. G. thanks$\ldots$''. Put sponsor 
acknowledgments in the unnumbered footnote on the first page.

\section*{References}

Please number citations consecutively within brackets \cite{b1}. The 
sentence punctuation follows the bracket \cite{b2}. Refer simply to the reference 
number, as in \cite{b3}---do not use ``Ref. \cite{b3}'' or ``reference \cite{b3}'' except at 
the beginning of a sentence: ``Reference \cite{b3} was the first $\ldots$''

Number footnotes separately in superscripts. Place the actual footnote at 
the bottom of the column in which it was cited. Do not put footnotes in the 
abstract or reference list. Use letters for table footnotes.

Unless there are six authors or more give all authors' names; do not use 
``et al.''. Papers that have not been published, even if they have been 
submitted for publication, should be cited as ``unpublished'' \cite{b4}. Papers 
that have been accepted for publication should be cited as ``in press'' \cite{b5}. 
Capitalize only the first word in a paper title, except for proper nouns and 
element symbols.

For papers published in translation journals, please give the English 
citation first, followed by the original foreign-language citation \cite{b6}.
